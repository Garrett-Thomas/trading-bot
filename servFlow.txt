- When the server is launched, it should start the 
server. I should have scripts in node controlling 
program flow and starting the other python scripts. 
I don't know how much memory and idle python program 
creates and that is something i will have to find out. 

- Server Launches > Master Python Program launches and 
determines if it needs to collect data or not. > Trades 
are made based upon data. Calls are made constantly 
to robinhood to get portfolio value. > Port value is 
served to client along with recent trades.
