Progress:
  Currently scrapes data from listed exchanges. Stores data in JSON files. That is done
  in stockFetcher script. StockPicker.py will use that data to make a trading decision.

[] Switch to different webdriver. Maybe firefox. Chrome takes too much
memory and is slow.

[x] continously log data to build a dataset

[x] figure out button manipulation on the website

[c] place all the stock names in a seperate file, either txt or json

[] at some point integrate with a real exchange and make trades! (maybe)

How should my algorithm work?
I have two variables determining how much is bought. One called buy depth 
and the other is sell depth. An oversite I made was the fact that you need to 
own the stock to sell it. 

Sell current stock if they are ranked lower than toBuy stocks.
